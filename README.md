# E-commerce

This is a basic e-commerce website which is build using Spring Boot at Backend and AngularJS at frontend. It is not a full-fledged website but it is built using primary and basic knowledge of Spring Boot and TypeScript. Here we have working API's for Products, have pagination support, some services as well. Initially I've added for products in my website.

This project has more java and angular files than what have been added, I'm continuously trying to improve my website more and more.
